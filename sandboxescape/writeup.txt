Exactly 100% the same bug that I'm still reproducing when I escaped the adobe reader sandbox with a filepicker window (see CVE-2018-8314).

We just create a special junction folder locally in the favorites folder now (a folder with the name "{0AFACED1-E828-11D1-9187-B532F1E9575D}" and a target.lnk inside)
Then open it with the IE11 broker.

As a result we can render javascript at medium integrity.

This is 100% the same bug I reported earlier, the only difference is that for Adobe Reader I had to place the junction on a remote network share because I couldn't get it to work locally.
At the time (a year ago) you guys said I wouldn't get a bounty because it was patched in the insider build.
Well.. this still works a year later. So I'm kind of moody.

Also.. since the issue is in the filepicker code.. this might break other sandboxes too.... 

To repoduce: Move testdll.dll and injectdll.exe into a folder.. add the all application packages ace to the folder and inject testdll.dll into the appcontainer process of IE11.

Check the demo .. you should get those results.

I don't know why it didn't get patched, maybe I'm just a retarded bear and I have no clue what I'm talking about.
